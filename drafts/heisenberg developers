Micromanagement denotes multiple things:
- Need to sync frequently = sign that people is not on the same page. Compensates for lack of planning, estimation and communication skills.
- Need to verify progress frequently = lack of trust. Compensates for people that are not honest about being blocked.

If you want to end this situation: update your tickets with details about your progress. If someone asks you for an update, refer them to the ticket. If they have a question, refer them to the ticket. Keep all the project management discussions on the issue tracker.

Then, compare, what is better:
- fixing a problem with time (preventive) or fixing a problem with no time, customer and reputation impact (reactive).
- slower at first but sustained development speed and scalable team growth (controlled technical debt) or faster at first but decaying development speed with developer/bottlenecks (uncontrolled technical debt).
- to invest in your employees and lead on consensus, or keep an army of demoralized people and lead on fear and authoritarism.
