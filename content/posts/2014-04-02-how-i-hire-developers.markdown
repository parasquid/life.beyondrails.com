I was invited to pressent at the [KL Ruby Brigade](http://www.projectrenaissance.com/technology/kl-ruby-brigade-2) and I thought I shuld mix things around by talking about something not very technical but still very much relevant to the audience.

Since I'm in charge (but saying "in-charge" is a bit of a misnomer since in Mindvalley we don't really have predefined job descriptions) of the internship program for new tech hires, I figures I should share some of the things I consider when interviewing and hiring people.

Here are the slides :)
