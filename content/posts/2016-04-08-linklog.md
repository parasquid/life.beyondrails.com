**Producing Documentation for your Rails API**<br />
https://blog.codeship.com/producing-documentation-for-your-rails-api<br />
We're doing a lot of new software at work, and most of them are APIs to help out with task parallelization. Here's a really good article to help guide everyone on the team on producing good API documentation.

**The Making of an Expert**<br />
https://hbr.org/2007/07/the-making-of-an-expert<br />
Lately I've been spending time on self-improvement, and the question I find asking myself now is: How do I achieve mastery? This is an old article from the Harvard Business Review, but the lessons in there are timeless.

**Apprenticeship Patterns**<br />
http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html (online book)

I've been recommending this book for all new hires at my company, and I've learned a lot from the book myself. Definitely a must read.<br />

**So Good They Can't Ignore You**<br />
http://amzn.to/1qaX6cI<br />

I'm currently reading this book and it's been an interesting read so far. The author argues that the belief of following your passion is a dangerous advice, and that you need to save up enough "career capital" before you can get meaningful work with autonomy and control.

**Architecture: the Lost Years**<br />

Uncle Bob Martin makes the case for "pluggable architecture" where your business logic is separated from your delivery mechanism and persistence layers. The ideas presented will challenge how you think about your application.
