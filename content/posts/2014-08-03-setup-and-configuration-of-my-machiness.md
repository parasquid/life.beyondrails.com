I've just recently (re)installed Linux on my Acer V5 122p. Had to fiddle around with UEFI settings thinking to preserve my Windows 8.1 partition, but eventually I had to bite the bullet. I wiped the whole partition clean and turned off UEFI so my installation would be a lot simpler.

I ended up installing PeppermintOS which is a very lightweight distribution. After installing a few updates, the system was snappy and fast. I started to install the usual apps and configuration I normally use, when I realized I don't have a document to use as a reference. I've been mostly doing stuff through memory and through Googling as soon as I encounter the problem or need.

Here's the blogpost to rectify that, as well as give you a glimpse as to how I like my machine setup and configured :)

Setup natural scrolling
-----------------------
Ever since I got my Macbook Air 2010 upgraded to Lion, I've been a fan of what Apple called "natural scrolling."

Setup Sublime Text
------------------
I know I should start learning Emacs, but Sublime Text (and before that, Textmate) had always been my editor of choice. That might change in the near future though :)

Key management
--------------
Yes, I keep my private key in Dropbox. I know many people would say that this is a security risk (and it is) but the keys that I do keep in Dropbox are only those with access to non-critical remote systems that I own. I run some rtorrent download boxes as well as some application servers that I use for quickly testing out application ideas.
