gaining strength

the best way to gain strength is through progressive overload. explain progressive overload.

It applies as well to your skills as a coder. if you resign yourself to just doing the things that are comfortable for you, you will never gain strength

strength is gained by reaching over your limits just that tiny bit until you adapt to the new load (physical or cognitive).

always put maximum effort, otherwise you won't be growing

the problem here is that like strength training, there is the possiblity of over reaching and exceeding limits and failure

allow yourself to fail; rest then recover then try again later

you won't grow into an arnold but your will reach your maximum potential. as it is many devs are happy to be a simple code monkey. so much waste.
