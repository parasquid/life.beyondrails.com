title: Setting Standards
draft: true

I have just finished reading a book called "He's Just Not That Into You," which talks about women trying to make sense of the confusing signals men give them, and finally acknowledging the fact that "he's just not into you."

I found that most of the advice given in the book applies to men as well (in deciphering the mixed signals women give out) most especially the exercises. One particularly useful one (I think) near the end of the book talks about standards. It makes you write down what you stand for, what you believe in, and what you will or won't tolerate. I think it's brilliant.

So now, here are my new standards that I will never ever forget nor forsake no matter how hot I think she is (I'll add to or remove from them as my preferences changes).

- I will never date a lady who is not clearly a good, kind, loving person.
- No matter how pretty or gorgeous she looks like, and no matter how much she throws herself at me, I refuse to touch a lady that will throw litter or spit on the streets.
- I will not date a lady who is a chain or an habitual smoker. Holiday smokers are tolerable, ladies willing to quit smoking are even more desirable, and ladies who absolutely abhor the smell of cigarette smoke are the best. I am making exceptions for shisha.
- I will not date a lady who is not sure she wants to date me.
- I will only ask a lady out three times; if I get turned down on all three, she's not that into me and I should just move on.
- I will never ever date a lady that does drugs.
- I will never date a lady that is an habitual drunk, or becomes "wild" when they get drunk. The emotional trauma just isn't worth it.
- I will not date a lady who is already married or already has a boyfriend.
- I will not, under any circumstance, spend my precious time with a lady who has already rejected me.

And here are the criteria I'm looking for in a date:

- I want to have a good conversation with her.
- She must be witty, intelligent, and a good conversationalist. Whenever I ask her how her day was, she shouldn't just answer with "it was very good" or "I had a great time." I want her to ask me questions and truly be interested in me. I want us to be able to exchange stories.
- I want a lady that does not need to play mind games with me, and will say what she wants. I believe that clear communication is very important.
- I probably won't be expecting much from bars and nightclubs, because these places attract a crowd that  are looking for a quick, short-term sexual relationship (both men and ladies). However, I _will_ still go out to bars and nightclubs with friends, if only to hang out with them. If I attract (or get attracted to) someone, it's just a bonus. I will not go to a bar or nightclub for the sole purpose of getting laid or finding a companion for the night.

Will I be able to follow my standards? We will see :)
