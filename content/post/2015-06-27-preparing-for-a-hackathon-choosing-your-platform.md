title: "Preparing for a Hackathon: Choosing Your Platform"

One of the best things you can do during your hackathon presentation is to have your hack available on a publicly accessible platform. You can definitely just host your app in your local machine for the demo, but it is more powerful and impressive if you can involve everyone else in a room and get them to play with  your hack during your demo.

Note: I'm a Ruby developer and my framework of choice during hackathons is Ruby on Rails, so my suggestions here would be biased accordingly. YMMV
