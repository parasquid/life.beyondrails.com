>  I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of science, whatever the matter may be.

### Measurement is essential to progress and improvement.

Imagine being inside a pitch-black room and asked to walk towards the door. Without knowing where you stand right now, at worst you'd be frozen in place and afraid to move forward. At best you'd be progressing very slowly and cautiously, constantly trying to check if there's a bump on the floor or an obstacle in your path.

A lot of teams forgo measurement because they fear they are measuring the wrong things. I feel that this is a misguided approach; like everything else in the universe, change will happen. It is better to start measuring *something* and then finding out that the measurement needs to be changed, rather than not doing any measurements at all. The act of measuring is in itself an act of learning and that, at the very least, is something of value.

## Measure to Improve, not to Reward or Punish

Ask yourself this: why do I want to measure performance?

Many of the managers and entrepreneurs I've talked to want to measure performance because they want to:

  * have the guarantee that their employees are working
  * pay salaries or compensation accordingly
  * calculate bonuses
  * find out who is under-performing

I feel that this mindset is from a perspective of distrust, and using a measurement to strike fear in the hearts of your team. Worse, you'll only get people to "game the system" by only focusing on the metrics that you have set, instead of the overall improvement of the company.

The correct mindset is to approach this with the intention of having the team improve itself. When the team knows where they stand, they also know where else they can go and how to become better. Better yet, they become [internally motivated][1] to improve themselves and in return you get to reap the benefits.

## What NOT to Measure

  * Hours in the office (instead of actual work done)
  * Lines of code (instead of feature impact)
  * Meetings attended (instead of valuable contribution)

... you get the idea. There are many measures that even big companies are implementing, but do not apply to knowledge workers (like your tech team).

As Dan Pink in this [TED Talk][1] mentioned, carrots and sticks (extrinsic motivators) worked fine for many kinds of Industrial Age tasks. But for the Information Age (especially with software development) where there aren't any simple rules and clear goals, these measurements are simply too narrow and restrictive. By measuring these, you're practically telling your team that "I'm only interested in the number of hours I see you in the office."

### Measure results, not activity.

That way, your team can exercise their creativity at reaching the results, instead of being constrained with the specific activities you only *think* will get you to that result.

Previously, we talked about why measurement is important. We also found that you need to have the correct intentions for making the measurements; otherwise you will only be misled by false confidence in the numbers.

## What to Measure

There really are only two important things you want to measure in your team: effectiveness and efficiency. Effectiveness is the raw output of work; when you ask for a financial report according to particular specifications, an effective tech team is able to execute the task with minimum deviation from the specs. As Peter Drucker in his [book](http://amzn.to/1WHK7hy) "The Effective Executive" famously said: effectiveness is doing the right things.

Efficiency however, can be thought of as "doing things right" (again by Peter Drucker). I like to think of it as having a multiplier effect: It does not contribute to results directly, but it multiplies whatever potential output there is. That means you want to prioritize effectiveness over efficiency; an effective but inefficient team can be optimised, but a very efficient team not doing the right things is a big waste of resources.

### Effectiveness &times; Efficiency = Results
In most cases you want to increase both; increasing just one or the other is like a multiplication equation. For example:

     2 effectiveness ×  10 efficiency =  20 results
     2 effectiveness ×  11 efficiency =  22 results
    40 effectiveness ×  10 efficiency = 400 results
     4 effectiveness × 100 efficiency = 400 results

## How to Measure

It is extremely seductive to think that by assigning numbers to particular activities, you get to manipulate the results like levers on a control panel. Unfortunately, real life is not just a simple math equation (it probably is, but so far nobody had been able to completely encompass all variables). It comes back to asking the question: why do I want to measure performance? It is not to control specific activities, but to find out where you stand as a team and discover ways to improve performance.

What _can_ be done is to measure *proxies*-- activities that most closely approximate the results you wanted to measure in the first place. Proxies are by definition not the exact thing you want to measure, but they can be close enough.

For example, the one of the [mathematical ways of calculating &Pi;](http://www.craig-wood.com/nick/articles/pi-archimedes/) is by Archimedes: you create triangles (whose boundaries can easily be measured) inside a circle (whose circumference is more difficult to measure) and try to approximate the the ratio from that. In otehr words, the more triangles he drew, the better his approximation to &Pi; gets.

This is the same idea with measuring proxies: you won't immediately be able to measure the exact results, but as you go along with the measurements you'll eventually end up adding more perspectives/sides to more completely see a more holistic picture.

### Ask them what have they done, what are they going to do, and is there anything that's preventing them from doing it

This is a measure of **Effectiveness**. These [three questions][2] are mostly used by Scrum methodology, but you don't have to practice the whole of Scrum to take advantage of this approach. The three questions allows your team to:

  * commit to each other on a task
  * find out how much progress has been made on a particular area
  * improve communication with each other
  * nip possible problems in the bud

The danger with this approach is ending up with a meeting and a status update. When you start asking questions like "why a particular workset is not yet done" or "why something is taking too long," you're not measuring anymore (and most likely agitating your team). These questions are not for your benefit but for the team's; it is their measure of whether the right things are getting done so that they know if they need to course-correct.

### Ask the team to rate their feelings for the last week

This is a measure of **Efficiency**. Most of the time we forget that we're hiring people, not robots. They have feelings and emotions, and these are important indicators of possible issues that are hiding beneath the surface.

You can use techniques like [Glad-Sad-Mad][3], [Stop-Start-Continue-More of-Less of][4], or assigning a numerical score and asking what would make the team member give the week a full 10.

You might encounter some push-back, however. When I first introduced the rating of feelings to my team, there was an initial hesitation. Some team mates jokingly mocked the activity as "feelings time" and were uncomfortable sharing what they felt during the week. Some complained that it's yet another waste of time for a meeting, and that it would only devolve into meaningless chatter. These are all valid points, and I had to take them into consideration when I persuaded them to just try it out for a month. I promised to that we'll drop the whole activity if we found that it didn't add any value to our team.

In the end we did find a lot of value for the activity. We managed to:

  * unearth certain issues that were personally affecting individual team members (burn-out, work dissatisfaction, family matters)
  * address concerns on team dynamics (teamwork, communication style)
  * understand each other better
  * have a more tightly-knit and bonded team

We kept the activity, and although some team members still don't want to talk about feelings, we just named the activity to "Sprint Score" but it's effectively the same thing.

### Ask the team to map out the road-map to your milestones

This is a measure of **Results**. Your team are the domain experts and are the best people to tell you how long a particular feature will take. The most you can do is to guide them towards what objectives are strategic (which you are expectedly the domain expert) but _how_ to get there is a question you shouldn't meddle with.

When the road-map is drafted, have it publicly visible on a board or on a wall, and whenever an item is done put a marker. There is something very visceral about having your objectives presented for everyone to see; this again comes back to the human and emptional aspect of teams. Whenever something gets done and is publicly celebrated (even with just a small gesture like crossing out a line item or [moving a card from "doing" to "done"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board)) the people concerned get a rush of hormones that make them even more efficient at their work, increasing their productivity.

## Conclusion

You might notice you have to ask a lot of things instead of objectively measuring things. This requires a very mature team that you can trust. You might need to work on trust issues first before you can even start meausring performance.

Remeber that you are also part of the team, and their performance is also your performance as their leader. If you think none of these suggestions work for your team, then try this: measure your own performance using any aspect or system you think best reflects yourself (afterall, you are the best person to know what you're capable of). After a week of measurements ask yourself: do these measurements truly reflect my performance?
