Hi, I’m Tristan! I’m a software developer currently living and working in Kuala Lumpur.

I work mostly in Ruby, some HTML/CSS/JS, DevOps and some Go.

My main interest is in server-side technology and massive scalability, but I’ve been known to dabble in native mobile development, user facing web applications and various other projects.

Check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/parasquid) to see what I’ve been up to recently!
