Hi, I’m Tristan! I’m a software developer currently living and working in Kuala Lumpur.

You can find me on facebook and github @parasquid.

Like many of you, I was a self-taught programmer. It all started many years ago when I was around 9 or 10; my father had an Apple ][+ clone called Minta ][ and I spent many nights typing in programs in BASIC from Byte magazine.

After that, came QBasic in high school (I was fortunate to have studied in a more technical school that taught programming and Wordstar, among other things) as well as C/C++ and dBase/Clipper.

After that, I joined an opensource project that was primarily in Perl and picked that up. Around 2005 the project leader introduced me to Ruby and I remember telling him "It's just like Perl!" and promptly forgot about it.

I picked up Java for a job I had in a VAS (valu-added services) company--we were making apps before they were cool--handling the applications that respond when you send an SMS to 2467. Then I rediscovered Ruby because of Mindvalley, and at that time also got introduced to Rails.

Unfortunately (or fortunately, as some might think) I skipped PHP altogether so I don't have as much of horror developer stories as the rest of us. :)

But now, I love Ruby. Its currently my favorite language. It's the hammer I use to solve all the problems that come my way.

Aside from Ruby, I also do some HTML/CSS/JS, DevOps and Go.

My main interest is in server-side technology and massive scalability, but I’ve been known to dabble in native mobile development, user facing web applications and various other projects.

Check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/parasquid) to see what I’ve been up to recently!
